      &emsp;I help companies connect people and processes together and connect
      to users around the world.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &emsp;I am a cloud developer and freelancer. I can help your company to
      make products easy to use and ensure they keep running, which may include
      redesigning your app or website and adding features. With my help you can
      keep your apps running smoothly with your costs and mission in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;I develop with the idea that software should be fast, accessible,
      and have an intuitive interface. The most important part of creating software is to
      get it out there for people to see and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;I grew up in Canada and recently moved my homebase to Peru, and I
      often travel while working remotely.

      The tools I use depend on the project requirements. If you require a full
      e-commerce site, I can help you get set up and hosted on popular platforms
      (Shopify, Wix...) and integrate 3rd party tools to help you manage your
      business. If you need your app hosted on cloud, I can help you determine
      what services you need to stay available for cheap.
